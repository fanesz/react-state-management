There is 3 branch in this repo:
- [normal-state-management](https://github.com/fanesz/react-state-management/tree/normal-state-management) - Feched data management using basic useState, and data filter using zustand.
- [useReducer-zustand](https://github.com/fanesz/react-state-management/tree/useReducer-zustand) - Fetched data management using useReducer from react, and data filter using zustand.
- [master](https://github.com/fanesz/react-state-management) - Fetched data and filter state management using useReducer and useContext, then provided with Provider so every data can be access by the child component without passing it by the props.
